    "### Camera Calibration\n",
    "\n",
    "The code for this step is contained in the notebook under step 1 chessboard size and camera calibration in the file called `AdvancedLaneFinding.ipynb`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I start by preparing \"object points\", which will be the (x, y, z) coordinates of the chessboard corners in the world. Here I am assuming the chessboard is fixed on the (x, y) plane at z=0, such that the object points are the same for each calibration image.  Thus, `objp` is just a replicated array of coordinates, and `objpoints` will be appended with a copy of it every time I successfully detect all chessboard corners in a test image.  `imgpoints` will be appended with the (x, y) pixel position of each of the corners in the image plane with each successful chessboard detection.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I then used the output `objpoints` and `imgpoints` to compute the camera calibration and distortion coefficients using the `cv2.calibrateCamera()` function.  I applied this distortion correction to the test image using the `cv2.undistort()` function and obtained this result: \n",

    "### Pipeline (single images)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Provide an example of a distortion-corrected image.\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate this step, I will describe how I applied the distortion correction to one of the test images like this one:\n",
    "![alt text][image2]\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you used color transforms, gradients or other methods to create a thresholded binary image.  Provide an example of a binary image result.\n",
    "\n",
    "I used many thresholds such as sobel magnitude, absolute sobel, red & green threshold, HLS S threshold, HLS L threshold, and HSV V threshold and combine all of these to generate a binary image. (thresholding at step 4 in `AdvancedLaneFinding.ipynb`).  Here's an example of my output for this step.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 3. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you performed a perspective transform and provide an example of a transformed image.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code for my perspective transform includes a function called `warped()`, which appears at step # the file `AdvancedLaneFinding.ipynb` (output_images/examples/example.py).  The `warped()` function takes as inputs an image (`img`), as well as source (`src`) and destination (`dst`) points.  I chose to hardcode the source and destination points in the following manner:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "#src\n",
    "    bottom_left = [225,720] \n",
    "    bottom_right = [1105, 720]\n",
    "    top_left = [570, 470]\n",
    "    top_right = [712, 470]\n",
    "#dst\n",
    "    top_left_dst = [320,0] \n",
    "    top_right_dst = [980,0] \n",
    "    bottom_left_dst = [320,720]\n",
    "    bottom_right_dst = [980,720]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This resulted in the following source and destination points:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Source        | Destination   | \n",
    "|:-------------:|:-------------:| \n",
    "| 225, 720      | 320, 720      | \n",
    "| 1105, 720     | 980, 720      |\n",

    "| 712, 470      | 320, 0        |\n",
    "\n",
    "I verified that my perspective transform was working as expected by verifing that my lanes appeared to be parallel in the warped image, as well as, straight/uncurved lane lines in the warped image if they appeared like straight lanes in the unwarped image. \n",

    "#### 4. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you identified lane-line pixels and fit their positions with a polynomial?\n",
    "\n",
    "Then I utilized a sliding window method to select the region of pixels that were my lane lines.  This sliding window limited the region in my image that the program had to look for possible lane line pixels.  After identifying the lane line pixels, the code fit a 2nd order polynomial to the points to create an approximate lane line, like this:\n",

    "#### 5. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you calculated the radius of curvature of the lane and the position of the vehicle with respect to center.\n",
    "\n",
    "I did this in step 6 in my code with the pipeline() function in the `AdvancedLaneFinding.ipynb` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. Provide an example image of your result plotted back down onto the road such that the lane area is identified clearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "I implemented this code in step 7 in `AdvancedLaneFinding.ipynb` in the function `pipeline()`.  Here is an example of my result on a test image:\n",

    "### Pipeline (video)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Provide a link to your final video output.  Your pipeline should perform reasonably well on the entire project video (wobbly lines are ok but no catastrophic failures that would cause the car to drive off the road!).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the final result of my computer program to determine the lane lines in the video and identify the area within the lane that is acceptable to drive.\n",

    "### Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Briefly discuss any problems / issues you faced in your implementation of this project.  Where will your pipeline likely fail?  What could you do to make it more robust?\n",
    "\n",
    "I had a lot of difficulties trying to implement the threshold portion of the project to get the code to detect enough of the lane lines without picking up too much noise from the rest of the image.  I also had a lot of difficulty combining all the thresholds into a final threshold to get the lane line pixels.  I had to do a lot of review on the different color spaces, read some discussions other students posted in the forums, and read a little bit more about color spaces online in order to get a firm handle on the color spaces.  It real is quite facinating how many different color spaces there are to utilize, how they came about, and what they can be used to identify within the image.  During the project I also had a little bit of trouble in trying to smooth the lane lines output when when the road became very light colored like the lane lines.  I thought about trying to implement a line line averaging method to solve this problem, but it was going to take a lot of additional code and some rewriting of my current compilation of code to get the averaging method to work.  I instead decided to rework my thresholding segment of code to allow for better detection of lane lines in the bright images.  I did this by changing the binary combination code and incorporating an HSV-V threshold, which is the value segment of the color space to better identify the lane lines.  My pipeline will most likely fail when it comes to bright pavement lane line images with shadows. If I spend more time incorporating the averaging method with lane line classes, then the program will be more robust in lane line detection. "
