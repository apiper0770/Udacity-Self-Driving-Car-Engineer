    "## Project: Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Program\n",
    "---\n",
    "In this project, I will use what I've learned about deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs. I will train and validate a model so it can classify traffic sign images using the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). After the model is trained, I will then try out my model on five images of German traffic signs that I found on the web.\n",

    "###Data Set Summary & Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "####1. Provide a basic summary of the data set. In the code, the analysis should be done using python, numpy and/or pandas methods rather than hardcoding results manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data set is a group of German Traffic signs that are labeled.  In total there are 43 different types of german traffic sign.  I utilized the traffic sign classifier and standard python procedures to analyze the results of the classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "####2. Include an exploratory visualization of the dataset.\n",

    "\n",
    "####1. Describe how you preprocessed the image data. What techniques were chosen and why did you choose these techniques? Consider including images showing the output of each preprocessing technique. Pre-processing refers to techniques such as converting to grayscale, normalization, etc. (OPTIONAL: As described in the \"Stand Out Suggestions\" part of the rubric, if you generated additional data for training, describe why you decided to generate additional data, how you generated the data, and provide example images of the additional data. Then describe the characteristics of the augmented training set like number of images in the set, number of images for each class, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "As a first step, I cropped the images with the microsoft software point to get just the image of the sign itself and remove a lot of the background and additional signs in the images.   Then I proceeded to convert the images to a height and width of 32x32 pixels, while maintaining the three color channels.  \n",

    "Here is an example of a traffic sign image before processing:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image5]\n",
    "\n",
    "I wanted the classifier to be able to identify images of poor quality and signs that might be small in size within the image, which equates to less pixel representation of the image.  This is what the image looks like after processing:\n",

    "![alt text][image6]\n",
    "\n",

    "####2. Describe what your final model architecture looks like including model type, layers, layer sizes, connectivity, etc.) Consider including a diagram and/or table describing the final model.\n",

    "####3. Describe how you trained your model. The discussion can include the type of optimizer, the batch size, number of epochs and any hyperparameters such as learning rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to train the model I utilized a batch size of 128, 10 epochs, and a learning rate of 0.001.  With these parameters I passed the results of training into the adam optimizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "####4. Describe the approach taken for finding a solution and getting the validation set accuracy to be at least 0.93. Include in the discussion the results on the training, validation and test sets and where in the code these were calculated. Your approach may have been an iterative process, in which case, outline the steps you took to get to the final solution and why you chose those steps. Perhaps your solution involved an already well known implementation or architecture. In this case, discuss why you think the architecture is suitable for the current problem.\n",

    "* validation set accuracy of 94%\n",
    "* test set accuracy of 86%\n",

    "If a well known architecture was chosen:\n",
    "* I utilized the LeNet architecture for this traffic sign classifier\n",
    "* I thought that LeNet would be a good fit because the previous examples in lectures showed the LeNet classifier idnetifying image shapes and colors very well.\n",
    "* The models validation accuracy and test accuracy illustrate that the model is a decent fit for identifying traffic signs; however, the model can still use some improvements like dropout being incorporated into the model to help the model generalize better and prevent the system from over fitting.\n",

    "###Test a Model on New Images\n",
    "\n",
    "####1. Choose five German traffic signs found on the web and provide them in the report. For each image, discuss what quality or qualities might be difficult to classify.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are five German traffic signs that I found on the web:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image1] ![alt text][image2] ![alt text][image3] \n",
    "![alt text][image4] ![alt text][image5]\n",
    "\n",
    "The first image might be difficult to classify because it is just a white arrow on a blue background and there are several white arrows on blue backgrounds in the data set that it could be easily mixed up with.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second image might be difficult to classify because the zero in the number 30 might get mixed up with the zeros in any of the other speed limit signs because they all have zeros in them and in addition they all have the same colors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third image shouldn't be to difficult to classify this one should be pretty easy.  There are no other images with the same center symbol on the sign.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fourth image may be difficult to classify because the image has a car\n",
    "\n",
    "The fifth image may be difficult to classify because it is another image with white arrows on a blue background.  The number and direction of the arrows is the only thing that makes the sign different from any of the other arrow signs is the number and direction of the arrows within the sign.\n",
    "\n",
    "####2. Discuss the model's predictions on these new traffic signs and compare the results to predicting on the test set. At a minimum, discuss what the predictions were, the accuracy on these new predictions, and compare the accuracy to the accuracy on the test set (OPTIONAL: Discuss the results in more detail as described in the \"Stand Out Suggestions\" part of the rubric).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the results of the prediction:\n",

    "The model was able to correctly guess 3 of the 5 traffic signs, which gives an accuracy of 60%. This model needs some more improvement, but is a basic start to developing a fully reliable traffic sign classifier. \n",
    "\n",
    "####3. Describe how certain the model is when predicting on each of the five new images by looking at the softmax probabilities for each prediction. Provide the top 5 softmax probabilities for each image along with the sign type of each probability. (OPTIONAL: as described in the \"Stand Out Suggestions\" part of the rubric, visualizations can also be provided such as bar charts)\n",
    "\n",
    "The first, third, and fourth images the classifier positively identified and had at least a 30% probability or higher.  The other two images it got wrong.  I want to look at the second image, which is the 30km/h speed limit sign.  It was 59% sure that it was a general caution sign.  I think that this might be caused by the fact that both are the same color.  The last sign, which was a roundabout ahead sign, the classifier only got an 11% probability on.  I think that this means that the classifier is probably over fitting the data because there are a lot of signs with blue backgrounds and white arrows.  I probably need to adjust the classifier to not overfit the data from training  by adding a dropout functionality to my classifier.  Refer to the below table for information on the probabilities obtained from the program.\n",
